The goal of the project was to design a bakery app using react. The application help user find bakeries by names and gives them the option to filter by dietary restrictions as:

-Gluten-free
-Nut-free

It also gives them the option to sort the bakeries by price. It is a very useful application as it provides all these functionality to the user in a nice interface.
Here is the link to the project https://sweetpie679.github.io/react/ 

The page is organised into a grid. The left has options and the right has the bakereis where users can add these to the cart.I chose to use the grid layout because it is ideal for the type of the application, a shopping cart, normally displayed as a grid of items.

I used the bakery cart to display individual items fetched from the Bakery Item json file which was passed a a props function. All items states were changed during rendering the components. I had four main components, the bakery item component, the shopping cart and the sorting and filtering componnents.

To account for the usability principles, I considered choice of colors and layout, learnability and memorability features. I think the app can easily be learned and returning users can have good time navigating the user interface.
